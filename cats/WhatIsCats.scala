/**
  - Cats is a library which provides abstractions for FP in Scala.
  
  - A broader goal of Cats is provide a foundation for an ecosystem of pure, typelevel libraries to support FP in scala.
  
  - Monads, and related concepts, are the FP equivalent of OO design pattern- architectural building blocks that
    turn up over and over again in code. They differ from OO pattern in 2 main ways:
    1. they are formally, and thus precisely defined 2. they are extremely general.
    Everyone find generality/abstraction difficult, however, it is generality that allows concepts like monads to be
    applied in such a wide variety of situations.
